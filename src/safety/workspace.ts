 * `git worktree remove --force` can fail with "Directory not empty" on Windows -

 * worktree reasonably ran `pnpm install` to validate its own fix, and something
 * inside the resulting node_modules tree (pnpm's deeply-nested .pnpm store, or a
 * lingering watch-mode/dev-server child process the provider CLI's own internal
 * tool-use loop spawned and didn't clean up before exiting - outside
 * process-runner.ts's killDescendants reach, since it's not a process we spawned
 * directly) held a file handle open. Two real tasks left an orphaned worktree
 * *and* git branch behind this way, discoverable only by noticing `git worktree
 * list` still listed them days later.
 *
 * Retried a couple of times first (many locks clear within a second or two once
 * the offending process actually exits), then falls back to a direct recursive
 * `fs.rm` (the same Windows-safe retry pattern already used in this repo's own
 * tests) + `git worktree prune` to fix up git's own bookkeeping. This is what
 * actually guarantees nothing is left behind forever, even when git's own removal
 * logic can't cope with what got installed inside the worktree.
